####5. Santa smokes!
      The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  
      And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.  
       
####4. In the 1820s, you can open a house's shutters before you throw up your sash (which I assume are the curtains)
      Away to the window I flew like a flash,
      Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

####3. Santa uses magic to get up the chimney like Samantha on *Bewitched*
      And laying his finger aside of his nose,
      And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!
  
  
####2. The reindeer and the sleigh are tiny
      When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
      But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.
                                  
*..because*
  
####1. Santa is an ELF!
      He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
  
  
####Bonus
  
If you owned 8 flying reindeer, youd be hard pressed to pick a better name than, **Comet**
  
Unless, of course, you picked Donner (actually Donder) and Blitzen.  
  
Why? Those names are German for *thunder* and *lightning*.
  
Santa is so metal.
  
Dancer and Prancer must be pissed.
