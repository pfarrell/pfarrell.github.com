##Get off your box
* Black coffee or no coffee
* don't leave vim (your REPL needs buffers, :!, and :vsp)
* How many weeks old is your screen session
* Detach the mouse
* Disable the touchpad
* Discover how well you know your platform.  Unplug your internet connection 
* Do it without a data store
* Redis is the only data store
* Do it without a middle tier
* Do it without loops
* Do it without IO
* Strings, ints, binary, and associative arrays can build many things
* Explain the deepest computer problem you know to a child



##Shoulders of Giants
This is an homage to Brian Eno's excellent work [*Oblique Strategies*](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/).  
The title refs [MGMT's homage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ISc-b-6CE#t=0m9s) to Eno himself.
