##Get out of your box
* Black coffee or no coffee
* Perform every development task without leaving vim
  * that means: buffers, :!, and :vsp
* Use screen so your sessions lives for days
* Develop without an internet connection
  * local pdfs or dead tree *only*
* detach the mouse, disable the touchpad
