Sticking with one language deprives you of blissful A-HA moments.

I've been dating several lanaguages for a while... nothing serious.  
I get functional, but keep hearing Haskell's type system is the crown jewel.  
I [glimpsed a shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave) in C# today that made me understand how type systems matter.

I've got a TSQL parser, I'm working my way down a form of an abstract syntax tree and wanting to run code based on... you guessed it... type.

Here's the problem:

    class A   {...}
    class B:A {...}
    class C:A {...}

    class D:B {...}
    class E:C {...}


I want to segment functions like this:

    void Process(D d) { do things avabilable and specific to D}
    void Process(E e) { do things avabilable and specific to E}



The API gives me things like this, though

    Continer<A>[] {D, E}



That is, the container is typed as A, but I want to deal with D and E as their most specific types.

With C#, I can't come up with a great way to segment the types D and E, keeping them at their most specific,
without some form of an if/else control structure.

This was today's A-HA moment.  
When I hear how a type system (or duck typing) solves problems, I never fully _got_ it.


Now I do.

{I promise to finish this post with a counter example of how to fix this with types as soon as I figure it out.}
