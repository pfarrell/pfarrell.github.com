title: "DRAFT: What are you constrained by?"
tldr: "You can't change constraints, but sometime challenges seem like constraints"
---

In every situation, there are challenges and there are constraints.  This is especially true in software, both in the code itself and in the problems that software solves.

* Challenges are things that are possible.
* Some Constraints are non-negotiable.
* Constraints are the root of your challenges

And this is the point

* You are constraints may challenges.

The abilty to dig down to the constraints of a problem is a core technique of the best problem solvers.  It is the mental jump you have to make to change from being an "engineer" to an "architect" which is just a way of talking about how core the decisions you make are to the system you are building.  

Pretend you're designing an airplane.

You are bound by constraints and you will try to overcome challenges.  Behind every challenge, is a constraint.                                          

What are your constraints?
* The thing you are building must be able to fly
* It must be safe
* It must be able to carry passengers
* It must be able to carry cargo

I have a coworker with a very clear mind and a very sharp way of putting things.  He is exceptional at not accepting the status quo.  This is something I often struggle to change in myself.  I can be too quick to looking for solutions with what's available to me rather than imagining the ways I could reframe the context of the problem.

One of my strength/weaknesses is, when confronted with a problem, I quickly assess the tools available to me and formulate avenues of attack using what I think is available to me.  My coworker is adept as seeing past solving the problem at hand and, instead, seeing underlying assumptions that, obvious after he points them out, were invsible to me, moments before.

I asked him how he does this.  Here's what he said.

When looking at a problem, there are constraints and there are challenges.  Constraints define the boundaries of the problem.  Challenges arise from constraints.  

Constraints

Gravity is a constraint
The speed of light is a constraint 
The length of a second is a constraint

When looking at a problem.  Ask yourself what are the problems you see.  Then ask yourself is that problem a constraint or  a


Think about Google's Spanner database.  If you don't know, it's a database that allows transactions to be performed on data without having to coordinate those transactions with other servers.  This allows for true multi-master database interactions without
